Academic Resource App is a free web app whose goal is to provide students with college textbooks without having to spend an outrageous amount of money throughout one’s college process. This centralized platform consists of all CUNY campuses so that students can search for their materials by departments, sections and/or classes relevant to their campus. The motivation for this app goes beyond saving money but also take part in reducing the need to overproduce textbook through reusing. In addition, it is more convenient for students to navigate and find the necessary materials since each campus resource page is familiar to the student themselves.
Similar web apps include Chegg, CampusBooks, and SlugBooks but what makes our app unique is the familiarity and the users themselves. As described above, the main purpose for this app is to include the information from each campus so students can navigate with ease. The latter part is the users themselves because students can only join through the verification of the student’s school email. This ensures that buyers/sellers are not fake but also act as a communication device for students in the same college.
